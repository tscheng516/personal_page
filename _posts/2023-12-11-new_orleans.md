Conference blog.

I am attending [Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/calendar) (Neurips2023) now and I am happy to share my experience with you all. I will write a short summary every day.

# Theory Time
Two tutorials for today. The panel sessions after each tutorial are great and inspirational.

Talks I have attended
======
* [Recent and Upcoming Developments in Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra for ML](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/tutorial/73954)

TLDR: There is no popular random models yet in the field. The authors call for some user-friendly packages for researchers.

Comment: I like the brief explanation of traditional random LA (linear algebra) methods and the modern ones in machine learning. I also come over with similar problems where I need to design the experiments from scratches. 

* [Reconsidering Overfitting in the Age of Overparameterized Models](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/tutorial/73955) (Highlight of my day)

TLDR: Understand harmless overfitting through the lens of over-parametrized linear regression model. 

Comment: I have been working on this toopic and yet I stll find the talk interesting. The speaker managed a good tradeoff between high level explanation and math details.
