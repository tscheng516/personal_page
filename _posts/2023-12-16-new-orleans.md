Conference blog.

I am attending [Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/calendar) (Neurips2023) now and I am happy to share my experience with you all. I will write a short summary every day.

# Workshop

It was a difficult choice for me to pick one particular workshop to attend, like yesterday. But since I am researching on machine learning theory, the [workshop on Mathematics of Modern Machine Learning](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/66507) seems the first choice for me.

The talk, which is the highlight of my day, is [Benefits of learning with symmetries: eigenvectors, graph representations and sample complexity](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/66507#collapse83692).
TLDR: Many datasets or tasks have some group-equivariant structure. Exploiting this one could get a refined generalization bound. The talk is delivered elegantly with mathematics and examples.

# Postface

The conference is ended and it has given me a revelation on machine learning. I am really glad that I have attended the conference. 
Now it is time to drink a cup of tea and digest what I have learnt in New Orleans.
