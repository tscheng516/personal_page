Conference blog.

I am attending [Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/calendar) (Neurips2023) now and I am happy to share my experience with you all. I will write a short summary every day.

# Posters

I have been on the poster sessions for two days. On Thursday, I have presented my [paper](https://tscheng516.github.io/personal_page/publication/neurips2023).
